# Calculate the month and year of when DC One Million (Detective Comics #1000000) will be released - based on how 2 issues a month now being released 

## Rev 5; Researched what the maximum date range was in python, according to the official python 3.10 documentation on datetime (which would apply to pandas also) the maximum allowed year is 9999. So calculation needs to be done manually by me and not using datetime

## Rev 6; Successfully calculates Year and Months past the datetime constraint. Next options: Use proper date format, User Input? GUI?
